        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Midwest Art Deco is about appreciating Art Deco Architecture across the country.  Matt does it with his handy &#x1f4f7; , a Sony a6000, or his iPhone C</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mattinnati/">@mattinnati</a> lives in Cincinnati, OH and spends his time protecting, photographing, and renovating old buildings.  He also makes time to ride his bike (both human and gas powered) around town, enjoys live music, and loves crushing Hudy 14-K.</p>
        <p>If you need more Matt, check out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/decayofpastglory/">@decayofpastglory</a> to see the old buildings he ends up inside.
